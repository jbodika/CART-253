# Brainstorm ideas for the main project and the 3 variations of it 

## Main Idea
Papa's Pizeria game or cooking simulation game <br/>
Flappy bird game

### Variations Brainstorm

#### Flappy Bird
1. inverted game the whole world is upside down
2. mode where the player moves the obstacles and not the bird
3. flappy bird controlled by sound from user's microphone

#### Smoothie making sim called Smoo Vee's
1. reverse-cooking (instead of starting with nothing you start with the actual drink and deconstruct it)
2. gravity mode (ingredients are floating everywhere)/ orrr you make movements & decisions controlled by the mic (ex make noise to pour milk etc..)
3. 
~~3. black and white mode ??~~ N/A since the game built from scratch counts as a variation
