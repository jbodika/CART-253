2. Add items that frogs hate eating (do research)
3. Add a shaking feature to the flies moving around
4. Display the flies falling with the frog's tongue
5. 3 Lives? if the frog misses 3 times the game is over
6. as the frog eats mor eflies it gets bigger and bigger
7. as the game gets harder maybe a snake tries to eat it or when it gets at a certain number like 30?
